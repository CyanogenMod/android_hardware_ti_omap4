 * bvbuffmap - The bvbuffmap structure is used to track resources
 * associated with a buffer, such as a h/w MMU entry.  The implementations
 * add bvbuffmap objects when they allocate the resources.  Then when a
 * buffer is accessed, the implementations can regain access to the
 * associated resources.  The implementations allocate and populate this
 * structure when a bv_map() call is made.  It is used in subsequent
 * bv_blt() and bv_unmap() calls.  The latter frees the associated resource
 * and the structure (if applicable).  Note that a given resource might be
 * used by more than one implementation.
